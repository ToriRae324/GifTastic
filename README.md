This page allows users to view 10 gifs on the selected subject from Giphy. Users can also add a button of their subject choosing to be added to the set of buttons. Gifs are loaded as a still image, clicking the image will play the moving gif.

Bootstrap is used for the buttons and layout. The Giphy API is used to retreive gif images within the Javascript file.

The finished page can be seen at: https://torirae324.github.io/GifTastic/
